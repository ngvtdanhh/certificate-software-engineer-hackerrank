# 🧰 OOP & Software Design – Summary Notes

---

## 🧱 1. Object-Oriented Principles (OOP)

- **Encapsulation** – Hide internal state via access modifiers
- **Abstraction** – Focus on essential features
- **Inheritance** – "is-a" relationship
- **Polymorphism** – Same interface, different behavior

---

## 🏗️ 2. Design Principles

- **SOLID Principles** (esp. SRP, OCP)
- Composition over inheritance
- Separation of concerns
- DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself

---

## 🧪 3. Common Design Patterns (Intro Level)

| Pattern       | Use Case                   |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Singleton     | Ensure one instance        |
| Factory       | Create objects dynamically |
| Observer      | Publish-subscribe logic    |

## 💡 Software Engineer Mindset

- Readability, maintainability, and testability > just "it works"
- Write modular and reusable code
- Always comment intent, not just implementation

---

## 🧠 HackerRank Advice

- Prefer classes over large procedural code
- Use constructors for input parsing
- Simulate systems (e.g., event queue, task runner)
